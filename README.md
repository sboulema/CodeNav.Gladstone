## Known shortcomings of [VisualStudio.Extensibility](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility)

### [RemoteUI](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility/blob/205f50bec40166533d30b13a281af3ab9cd288ff/docs/new-extensibility-model/inside-the-sdk/remote-ui.md)
- Remote UI doesn't allow referencing your own custom controls.
- A Remote user control is actually instantiated in the Visual Studio process, not the process hosting the extension: the XAML cannot reference types and assemblies from the extension but can reference types and assemblies from the Visual Studio process.

### [Installation](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility/issues/128)
- No way to generate a vsix
